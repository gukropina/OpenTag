Open Tag Developement


This is the newest iteration of the open tag project using Lean startup
principles. I will build small, testable pieces of code and do
tests on their functionality while building towards the bigger project.
I will document my work, and that will become my lesson plan.
*/

/****************
Overview
I'm going to start off by sending a signal that has one bit of information.
This is based off of a television remote.

**Protocol:**
All signals are sent on a 38 kHz carrier wave. All the signals are multiples
of the X, where X is a unit of time that ensure reliable transmission and
receiving of the IR signal.

Start: three times X
1: two times X
0: X
Space between signals: X
End: four times X         //so if the signal is too long, I'll stop receiving

**The timing of your protocol is empirically determined. Miles tag uses
600 microseconds. The maximum a signal can be timed using ints is 32,000.
I tested sending a 30,000 microsec signal, and I could see it, so the
maximum that my protocol length can be is 7,500 microseconds.

My IR receivers will go low for a 30,000 microsecond 
signal and have about a maximum of 10% error in the timing that I receive.
(aka, if I send a 600 microsec signal, I will see around a 540 microsec
signal. This was derived empirically [via testing])




There are Y bits sent, which corresponds to Z number of possible players

**Checksum**
I will not have a checksum. If the protocol is having trouble, then I will add
a checksum. But it's harder to build with a checksum. So I won't start with one
I could also have the person send the data twice, and if you get the signal
twice, then it's valid.

I call the data that is being sent the packet.

The receiver that I am using is active low. So receiving a signal is low.

/*
Degugging notes:
(These are old notes)
Serial data is being sent normally.
The send pulse function is working.
The send_tag function checks for new button presses correctly
