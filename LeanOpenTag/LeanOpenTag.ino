Open Tag Developement

Booyah

Note: Are you uploading to the correct board?

Current work:

Haven't added some sort of handler for interrupting sounds, so sounds are short.

Do next: 1. add the next two parts of your protocol: team and damage
            to do this, you need to change: variables, i_am_tagged, send_tag
            1.1 - You have successfully changed the send_tag function to accept integer
                  values for what you are going to send. (complete)
            1.2 - You now have to change the i_am_tagged function to read everything
                  Note: you will have to use global arrays to store who tagged you,
                  since you can only return one value from a function, and you want
                  to return error codes. (complete)
         2. Add #define statements for magic numbers in your code (99, 999, etc.)
         3. Change your send_tag arrays to all caps for global variables
         4. Base: make it so that if you are a base, and receive a tag w/ different team,
            you take 1 damage. At health = 0, you switch teams and have 1 health
            If you take damage from your own team, you gain health (up to max).
         5. Your send_tag function will need to be more complex to handle abilities, 
            and then send regular tags afterwards. Or maybe, before tagging, rebuild
            the arrays from defaults (or at least check them all).
            Change your send_tag function to take in integers for the arguments:
            ID
            Team
            Damage
            Unique attack modifier
            and build the tag to send off of those.
         6. Can you use your Piezo for input? (that would be a cool easter egg).
         7. When you add Neopixel library, you should have the send tag function turn off
            the timer automatically. (change your add pulse function to turn off timer)
            Since the Neopixel library uses interrupts.
         

All units are now on a 600 microsec protocol.

This is the newest iteration of the open tag project using Lean startup
principles. I will build small, testable pieces of code and do
tests on their functionality while building towards the bigger project.
I will document my work, and that will become my lesson plan.

/****************
Overview
I'm going to start off by sending a signal that has one bit of information.
This is based off of a television remote.

**Protocol:**
All signals are sent on a 38 kHz carrier wave. All the signals are multiples
of the X, where X is a unit of time that ensure reliable transmission and
receiving of the IR signal.

Start: three times X
1: two times X
0: X
Space between signals: X
End: four times X         //so if the signal is too long, I'll stop receiving

**The timing of your protocol is empirically determined. Miles tag uses
600 microseconds. The maximum a signal can be timed using ints is 32,000.
I tested sending a 30,000 microsec signal, and I could see it, so the
maximum that my protocol length can be is 7,500 microseconds.

My IR receivers will go low for a 30,000 microsecond 
signal and have about a maximum of 10% error in the timing that I receive.
(aka, if I send a 600 microsec signal, I will see around a 540 microsec
signal. This was derived empirically [via testing])

Current Protocol (microseconds):
0: 600
1: 1200
Start: 1800
End: 2400
Error: +/- 300

OR

0: 750
1: 1500
Start: 2250
End: 3000
Error: +/- 375


There are Y bits sent, which corresponds to Z number of possible players

**Checksum**
I will not have a checksum. If the protocol is having trouble, then I will add
a checksum. But it's harder to build with a checksum. So I won't start with one
I could also have the person send the data twice, and if you get the signal
twice, then it's valid.

I call the data that is being sent the packet.

The receiver that I am using is active low. So receiving a signal is low.
